		<div class="legal-text">
			<p>Last updated: January 28, 2026</p>
			
			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Aion ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data. We designed Aion to be privacy-first, which means we collect as little information as possible.</p>

			<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
			<p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect any personal data such as your name, email address (unless you contact support), or location.</p>
			<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Aion runs locally on your Mac. It monitors your running applications and system resource usage purely for the purpose of the app's functionality (Auto-Quit and Stats). This data never leaves your device.</p>
			<p><strong>Crash Reports & Analytics:</strong> We may use anonymous crash reporting tools to improve the app. These reports do not contain personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
			<p>We use Paddle as our merchant of record for processing payments and licensing. When you purchase Aion Pro, your payment information is handled directly by Paddle and is subject to their privacy policy.</p>

			<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
			<p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any information you provide us (such as support emails). Your local app data is protected by macOS system security.</p>

			<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
			<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

			<h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
			<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: support@7caifei.com</p>
