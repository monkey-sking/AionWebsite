			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Aion. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any data you share with us. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

			<h2>2. Data Collection (Privacy by Design)</h2>
			<p><strong>Aion is designed to operate locally on your macOS device.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>App Activity Data:</strong> Information about running applications and system resource usage is processed locally and in real-time to provide the core functionality of Aion. This data is <strong>never</strong> transmitted to our servers.</li>
				<li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, addresses, or phone numbers. We only collect your email address if you voluntarily contact our support team.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Licensing & Payments</h2>
			<p>We use Paddle for payment processing and license management. When you purchase Aion Professional, you provide your payment information directly to Paddle. Their use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy, which you can find on their website.</p>

			<h2>4. Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
			<p>To improve Aion, we may collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. These reports help us identify bugs and optimize performance. They do not contain personally identifiable information (PII).</p>

			<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
			<p>We implement strict security measures to ensure the safety of your data. Since most data stays on your machine, it is protected by macOS's native security features.</p>

			<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
			<p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete any personal information we may have (such as your support emails). To exercise these rights, please contact us at support@7caifei.com.</p>

			<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
			<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
